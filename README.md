# 01-Guessing
This program is a guessing game that has the computer select a number between 1 and whatever max the user wants. After that it is up to the user to guess the proper number. The program will tell the user if they are to high or to low and once the game is done, the program will tell the user how many times they guessed and will ask if the user wants to play again. 
Anyone is welcome to make their own versions of this program, I just ask to be credited if you use this as a base even though you don't have to do so under the law.
